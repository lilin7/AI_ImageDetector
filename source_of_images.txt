Our dataset actually includes six smaller datasets, 
1.person_with_mask train dataset,
2.person_with_mask test dataset,
3.person_without_mask train dataset,
4.person_without_mask test dataset,
5.not_person train dataset, 
6.not_person test dataset.

For the first two person_with_mask datasets, images come from from online community of data scientists and learning practitioners, Kaggle; 
and from personal source code datasets, Git.
